#What is this?
This project is an attempt to rewrite a project originally developed for my CSC207 course. The original version can be found [here.](https://github.com/CSC207-2022F-UofT/course-project-mewdy/tree/main)

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a logging application using Java, adhering to SOLID principles and following an MVC architecture. The application allows users to create custom questionnaires linked to specific metrics, log data based on these questionnaires, and visualize logged data over time. Key features include:

- Graphical interface with customizable graphs.
- Dark mode support for user interface.
- Persistent data storage using CSV files, ensuring data portability and user ownership.

## Features

- Metric Management: Create metrics with defined min and max values, and track associated data over time.
- Questionnaire Creation: Design custom questionnaires with various question types (scale, text field, numeric field).
- Logging and Data Visualization: Log responses to questionnaires with timestamps and visualize data trends.
- Action-Based System: Implement an action log to track changes, supporting undo functionality for user actions.
- Exportable Data: Store data in CSV format, ensuring accessibility and data integrity.
